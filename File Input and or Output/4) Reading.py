# Excellent! You’re a pro. Finally, we want to know how to read from our output.txt file. As you might expect, we do this with the read() function, like so:
#     print my_file.read()
# 1. Declare a variable, my_file, and set it equal to the file object returned by calling open() with both "output.txt" and "r". Next, print the result of using .read() on my_file, like the example above. Make sure to .close() your file when you’re done with it! 
# All kinds of doom will happen if you don’t.

my_file= open("output.txt", "r")
print(my_file.read())
my_file.close()
