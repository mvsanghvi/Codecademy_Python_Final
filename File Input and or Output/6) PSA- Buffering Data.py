# We keep telling you that you always need to close your files after you’re done writing to them. Here’s why! During the I/O process, data is buffered: this means that it is held in a temporary location before being written to the file. 
# Python doesn’t flush the buffer—that is, write data to the file—until it’s sure you’re done writing. One way to do this is to close the file. If you write to a file without closing, the data won’t make it to the target file.
# 1. Check out our extremely bad code in the editor. Click Run—you’ll note that our read_file.read() didn’t read any data back!
#     -Add a write_file.close() call after writing to the file but before reading it.
#     -Add a read_file.close() call after the print read_file.read() line
#     -Run the code again.
#     -This time, you’ll see the data come through!

# Use a file handler to open a file for writing
write_file = open("text.txt", "w")

# Open the file for reading
read_file = open("text.txt", "r")

# Write to the file
write_file.write("Not closing files is VERY BAD.")
write_file.close()


# Try to read from the file
print(read_file.read())
read_file.close()
