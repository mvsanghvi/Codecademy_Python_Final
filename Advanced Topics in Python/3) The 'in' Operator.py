# For iterating over lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings, Python also includes a special keyword: in. You can use in very intuitively, like so:

#     for number in range(5):
#     print number,
 
#     d = { 
#     "name": "Eric",
#     "age": 26
#     }
    
#     for key in d:
#     print key, d[key],
    
#     for letter in "Eric":
#     print letter,  # note the comma!

# In the example above, first we create and iterate through a range, printing out 0 1 2 3 4. Note that the trailing comma ensures that we keep printing on the same line.
# Next, we create a dictionary and iterate through, printing out age 26 name Eric. Dictionaries have no specific order.
# Finally, we iterate through the letters of a string, printing out E r i c.

# 1. For each key in my_dict: print out the key , then a space, then the value stored by that key. (You should use print a, b rather than print a + " " + b.)

my_dict = {
  "Name": "Megan",
  "Age": 25,
  "Brown Eyes": True
}

for key in my_dict:
  print(key, my_dict[key])
