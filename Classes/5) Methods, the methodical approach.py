# When a class has its own functions, those functions are called methods. You’ve already seen one such method: __init__(). But you can also define your own methods!

# 1. Add a method, description, to your Animal class. Using two separate print statements, it should print out the name and age of the animal it’s called on. 
# Then, create an instance of Animal, hippo (with whatever name and age you like), and call its description method.

class Animal(object):
  """Makes cute animals."""
  is_alive = True
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  # Add your method here!
  def description(self):
    print(self.name)
    print(self.age)
hippo = Animal("Bobo", 6)
